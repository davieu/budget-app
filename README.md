Budget buddy app

Not meant for mobile. Just a quickly made app. 

calculate your budget by making a list of your expenses and income

This frontend web-app used module patterns and data encapsulation through the means of IIFEs. By using IIFEs it made my code modular and also kept the separation of concerns as high priority. I used three controllers- one for data, ui and for the app. Using an app-controller was very useful to keep my code DRY. I had a module in my app-controller just for event listeners which made the overall app easier to follow and read. I enjoy the thought that I can look back at this app in the future and be able to work on it without the hassle of having to figure out what does what.
